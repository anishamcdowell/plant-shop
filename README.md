# E-Commerce: Plant Shop

## :seedling: About the Collaboration

This project was a collaboration with UX/UI designer [**Tanim Khan**](http://linkedin.com/tanimui). A huge thank you goes to Tanim for being kind enough to let me code a live version of his beautiful e-commerce plant shop design. Tanim's beautiful design can be found on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/16317978-Plant-Shop-V2-Landing-Page) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/126139001/Plant-Shop-V2-Landing-Page). With access to Tanim's figma source file I was able to reproduce a pixel perfect translation of his design.

This collaboration allowed me gain valuable experience with:

- Translating Figma designs to code
- Building an e-commerce UI that can be scaled up as needed with the use of React components
